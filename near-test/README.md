# The test project

## Notes

Before interaction with smart contract, user should register in the system and deposit some near.
This near will be used to pay for storage that user's tokens will use. Could be retrieved back. 

Before add liquidity to the pool the one should register at the tokens smart contract and send some tokens (deposit) to the contract account.

Storage deposit is a common feature of all near smart contracts


### Testing

- The view call is a non-mutable call of smart contract.
- Call is a potentially mutable call of smart contract.
